# HTML is better

### Some dynamic plots is in html file

### Some content needs to be added
Because my rmd file knit for more than an hour at a time, I don't have time to run again. 
So I'll attach the additions here. This content is attached to the end of the entire document.

 They're dynamic pictures, feel free to play with them. However, this exploration of the pattern of sentence sentiment change is just a thought. In this data, it's unpractical. First, it only contained texts instead of whole books/documents. Second, there's no paragraph ID in this document. If we truly want to analyze the pattern of sentiment expression, we should work on the paragraph level. Also, the texts this data contained might be the dialogs, instead of the authors' statements. If the above conditions are met, some sentiment change patterns should appear for each author's statement.
